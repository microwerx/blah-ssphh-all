# SSPHH

This is a program that implements the Scalable Spherical Harmonics Hierarchies algorithm.

It relies on the *Fluxions 3D Engine* which is a research graphics library. It also relies on the *StarFish* libraries which are support libraries handling a variety of different tools.

* `Damselfish` is a scripting language and JSON library
* `Hatchetfish` is a logging library
* `Sunfish` is a ray tracing library
* `Toadfish` is an audio library
* `Unicornfish` is a network library
* `Viperfish` is a Graphical User Interface library

The libraries above depend on the following libraries:

* `openexr`
* `czmq` and `zeromq`
* `curl`
* `GLFW`
* `GLEW`
* `SDL2`
* `SDL2_image`
* `SDL2_mixer`
